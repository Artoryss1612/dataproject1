# Hotel Revenue & Booking Performance
Project Overview
This dashboard provides a data-driven analysis of hotel performance, focusing on revenue generation, guest behavior, and operational requirements. It allows stakeholders to compare performance between City Hotels and Resort Hotels across a multi-year period (2018–2020).

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks four primary metrics at the top level:

Sum of Revenue: $29.12M (Total revenue generated during the selected period).

Average ADR (Average Daily Rate): $104.49 (The average rental income per paid occupied room).

Sum of Total Nights: 367.682K (Total volume of room nights stayed).

Average Discount: 25.81% (The average price reduction applied to bookings).
